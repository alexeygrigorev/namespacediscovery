\section*{Abstract}

In Computer Science, namespaces help to structure source code and
organize it into hierarchies. Initially, the concept of namespaces did not
exist for programming languages, and programmers had to manage the source code themselves
to ensure there were  no name conflicts. However, nowadays, namespaces are 
adopted by the majority of modern programming languages.

The concept of namespaces is beneficial for mathematics as well:
In mathematics, short one-symbol identifiers are very common,
and the meaning of these identifiers is hard to understand immediately.
By introducing namespaces to mathematics, we will be able to organize mathematical 
identifiers. Also, mathematicians will also benefit from a hierarchical organization of
knowledge in the same way programmers do. In addition, the structure
will make it easier to understand the meaning of each identifier in a document.

In this thesis, we look at the problem of assigning each identifier of a document
to a namespace. At the moment, there does not exist a special dataset where
all identifiers are grouped to namespaces, and therefore we need to create
such a dataset ourselves.

Namespaces are hard to prepare manually: building them requires a lot of time and effort.
However, it can be done automatically, and we propose
a method for automatic namespace discovery from a collection of documents.

To do that, we need to find groups of documents that use identifiers in the same way.
This can be done with cluster analysis methods.
We argue that documents can be represented by the identifiers they contain, and this
approach is similar to representing textual information in the Vector Space Model.
Because of this, we can apply traditional document clustering techniques for namespace
discovery.

To evaluate the results, we use the category information, and look for pure
``namespace-defining'' clusters: clusters where all documents are from the same category.
In the experiments, we look for algorithms that discover as many namespace-defining
clusters as possible. 

Because the problem is new, there is no gold standard dataset, and it is
hard to evaluate the performance of our method. To overcome it, we first 
use Java source code as a dataset for our experiments, since it contains the namespace 
information. We verify that our method can partially recover namespaces 
from source code using  only information about identifiers.

The algorithms are evaluated on the English Wikipedia, and the proposed method
can extract namespaces on a variety of topics. After extraction, the namespaces 
are organized into a hierarchical structure by using existing classification schemes 
such as MSC, PACS and ACM.
We also apply it to the Russian Wikipedia, and the results are consistent across
the languages.

To our knowledge, the problem of introducing namespaces to mathematics has not
been studied before, and prior to our work there has been no dataset where identifiers
are grouped into namespaces. Thus, our result is not only a good start,
but also a good indicator that automatic namespace discovery is possible.
