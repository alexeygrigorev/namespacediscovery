\subsection{Namespaces in Computer Science}

In computer science, a \emph{namespace} refers to a collection of terms that are managed
together because they share functionality or purpose, typically for providing modularity
and resolving name conflicts \cite{duval2002metadata}.


XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a framework for defining markup languages.
XML lets users define a set of tags to represent information in some
specific domain \cite{moller2006introduction}. For example, XHMTL is an XML
language for hypertext markup and MathML is a language for describing mathematical
notation. 

However, different XML languages may use the same names for elements and attributes. 
For example, consider two XML languages: XHTML for specifying the layout of web 
pages, and some XML language for describing furniture. Both these languages have 
the \verb|<table>| elements there, in XHTML table is used to present some data in 
a tabular form (see listing~\ref{code:xhtml-table}), 
while the second one uses it to describe a particular piece of
furniture in the database (see listing~\ref{code:xml-table}). 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML,caption={Describing tabular data in XHTML with 
the \texttt{<table>} tag},label={code:xhtml-table}]
<table>
  <tr><th>China</th><th>Germany</th><th>Russia</th></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML,caption={The \texttt{<table>} tag in an XML language for describing furniture},label={code:xml-table}]
<table id="table31337"> 
  <width unit="cm">130</width>
  <length unit="cm">90</length>
  <color>Black</color>
</table>
\end{lstlisting}

The \verb|<table>| elements have very different semantics in these languages 
and there should be a way to distinguish between these two elements. 
In XML this problem is solved with XML namespaces~\cite{xmlnamespaces}: 
the namespaces are used to ensure the uniqueness of attributes and resolve ambiguity.
It is done by binding a short namespace alias with some uniquely defined URI 
(Unified Resource Identifier), and then appending the alias to 
all attribute names that come from this namespace. In the example above, 
we can bind an alias \verb|h| with XHTML's URI \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1}
and then use \verb|<h:table>| to refer to XHTML's table. Likewise, 
in the furniture database language the element names can be prepended 
with a prefix \verb|d|, where \verb|d| is bound to some URI, e.g. 
\url{http://www.furniture.de/2015/db} (see listing~\ref{code:namespaces}).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML,caption={Namespaces in XML},label={code:namespaces}]
<html xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1">
  <h:body>
    <h:table>
      <h:tr><h:th>China</h:th><h:th>Germany</h:th><h:th>Russia</h:th></h:tr>
      <h:tr><h:td>10</h:td><h:td>3</h:td><h:td>1</h:td></h:tr>
    </h:table>
  </h:body>
</html>

<database xmlns:d="http://www.furniture.de/2015/db">
  <d:table id="table31337">
    <d:width unit="cm">130</d:width>
    <d:length unit="cm">90</d:length>
    <d:color>Black</d:color>
  </d:table>
<database>
\end{lstlisting}

% of the 80s/ 90s ...

The namespaces are also used in programming languages for organizing 
variables, procedures and other identifiers into groups and 
for resolving name collisions. In programming languages without 
namespaces the programmers have to take special care to avoid 
naming conflicts. For example, in the PHP programming language 
prior to version 5.3 \cite{mcarthur2008php6} there is no notion of namespace, and 
the namespaces have to be emulated to ensure that the names 
are unique, and this often results in long names like 
\verb|Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer|\footnote{\url{http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.7/Zend_Search_Lucene/Analysis/Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer.html}}.


Other programming languages have the notion of namespaces built in 
from the very first versions. For example, the Java programming 
language~\cite{gosling2014java} uses packages to organize identifiers into 
namespaces. In Java, packages solve the problem of ambiguity. For example, 
in the standard Java API there are two classes with the name \texttt{Date}: 
one in the package \texttt{java.util} and another in the package \texttt{java.sql}. 
To be able to distinguish between them, the classes are referred by their 
\emph{fully qualified name}: an unambiguous name that uniquely specifies the class
by combining the package name with the class name. Thus, to refer to a particular 
\texttt{Date} class in Java  \texttt{java.util.Date} or  \texttt{java.sql.Date} 
should be used. 

It is not always convenient to use the fully qualified name in the code to 
refer to some class from another package. Therefore in Java it is possible to 
\emph{import} the class by using the import statement which associates 
a short name alias with its fully qualified name.
For example, to refer to \texttt{java.sql.Date} it is possible to import 
it by using \texttt{import java.sql.Date} and then refer to it by the alias 
\texttt{Date} in the class \cite{gosling2014java}.


Although there  is no strict requirement to organize the classes into 
well defined groups, it is a good software design practice to put 
related objects into the same namespace and by doing this achieve 
better modularity. There are design principles that tell software engineers 
how to best organize the source code: classes in a well designed system 
should be grouped in such a way that namespaces 
exhibit low \emph{coupling} and high \emph{cohesion}~\cite{larman2005applying}. 
Coupling describes the degree of dependence between namespaces, and 
low coupling means that the interaction between classes of different 
namespaces should be as low as possible. Cohesion, on the other hand,
refers to the dependence within the classes of the same namespace, 
and the high cohesion principle says that the related classes 
should all be put together in the same namespace. 


\subsection{Namespaces in Mathematics}

Informally, a mathematical formula is a rule that shows the relationship
between different variables. For example, 
$x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2 a}$ is a formula for solving 
a quadratic equation $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$.


To give a more formal definition of formula, we first need to define 
a first-order language that contains primitive symbols such as
(1) parentheses, brackets and other boundary symbols 
(2) \emph{constants} ($1$, $2$, $\hslash$, ...) and variables ($x$, $y$, ...)
(3) \emph{functions} ($+$, $\cdot$, ...) and
(4) \emph{predicates}, e.g. binary relation symbols (``$=$'', ``$<$'', ``$\geqslant$'', ...). 

In this language, \emph{constants} are symbols with pre-defined meaning 
from some alphabet and variables are symbols that can be assigned 
a value from this alphabet.
Any symbol can be a variable, for example, $x$, $y$, $\mathbf w$, or it can 
be a symbol with subscripts, for example, $x_1, x_2, \ ...$ or even $w_\text{slope}$.

A \emph{well-formed term} $t$ (or just \emph{term}) in this language is defined as 
$$t \equiv c \mid x \mid f(t_1, t_2, \ ... \ , t_n)$$, which means that the term
$t$ can be a constant, a variable or an $n$-ary function 
$f(t_1, t_2, \ ... \ , t_n)$. An  \emph{$n$-ary function} is an 
function that takes $n$ terms $t_1, t_2, \ ... \ , t_n$ and produces 
some new term. An \emph{$n$-ary predicate} (or an \emph{$n$-ary relation symbol})
is typically a boolean-valued function that can be evaluated to \texttt{True} 
or \texttt{False} depending on the values it gets. 

Then an \emph{atomic well-formed formula} (or just \emph{formula}) in this language 
is a $n$-ary predicate with $n$ terms evaluated to \texttt{True} \cite{barwise2000language}. 

For example, $x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2 a}$ is a formula 
because it represents an equation that always holds true for a quadratic equation
$a\, x^2 + b\, x + c = 0$. The equality symbol ``$=$'' is a predicate that shows 
the relationship between variables $x_1, x_2$ and variables $a, b, c$. 

In logic we can use any symbol for variables without changing the meaning of the formula. 
For example, the energy-mass equivalence relation $E = mc^2$ can be written 
as $x = y z^2$ and it still will still hold true and remain a valid formula. 
However, there are research communities in mathematics that have developed
a special system of naming these variables, and these naming systems are 
called \emph{mathematical notations}. For each symbol in a formula, 
the notation assigns a precise semantic meaning. Therefore, because of the 
notation, in Physics it is more common to write $E = mc^2$ rather 
than $x = y z^2$, because the notation assigns unambiguous meaning to the symbols
``$E$'', ``$m$'' and ``$c$'', and the meaning of these symbols is recognized 
among physicists. 

% TODO: ``notation'' taken from wiki - need to find a better source 
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_notation
% maybe Wolska's thesis? 

However the notations may conflict. For example, while it is common to use 
symbol $E$ to denote ``Energy'' in Physics, it also is used in Probability and 
Statistics to denote ``Expected Value'', or in Linear Algebra to denote 
``Elimination Matrix''. 
We can compare the conflict of notations with the name collision problem in namespaces,
and solve it by extending the notion of namespaces to mathematical notation. 

Thus, let us define a \emph{notation} $\mathcal N$ as a set of pairs $\{ (i, s) \}$,
where $i$ is a symbol and $s$ is its semantic meaning,
such that for any pair $(i, s) \in \mathcal N$ there does not exist a pair 
$(i', s') \in \mathcal N$ with $i = i'$. 
Let us call $i$  \emph{identifier} and $s$ \emph{definition}, and 
then $(i, s)$ is an \emph{identifier-definition pair}.
We say that two notations $\mathcal N_1$ and $\mathcal N_2$
\emph{conflict} if there exists a pair $(i_1, s_1) \in \mathcal N_1$ and a pair
$(i_2, s_2) \in \mathcal N_2$ such that $i_1 = i_2$ and $s_1 \ne s_2$. 

Then we can define \emph{namespace} as a named notation, i.e. a pair 
$(\text{name}, \mathcal N)$ where $\mathcal N$ is a notation and ``name'' is
a string that uniquely defines the notation. For convenience we can use 
the Java syntax to refer to specific entries of a namespace. If 
$(\text{name}, \mathcal N)$ is a namespace and $i$ is an identifier such that 
$(i, s) \in \mathcal N$ for some $s$, then ``name.$i$'' is a 
\emph{fully qualified name} of the identifier $i$ that relates it to the 
definition $s$. For example, 
given a namespace $\big( \text{``Physics''},$ $\{ (E, \text{``energy''}),$ 
$(m, \text{``mass''}),$ $(c, \text{``speed of light''}) \} \big)$, 
``Physics.$E$'' refers to ``energy'' -- the definition of $E$ in the 
namespace ``Physics''. 

% TODO extend it to hierarchies ?

Analogously to namespaces in Computer Science, formally a mathematical namespace 
can contain any set of identifier-definition pairs that satisfies the definition of 
the namespace, but typically namespaces of mathematical notation
exhibit the same properties as well-designed Java packages: they 
have low coupling and high cohesion, meaning that all definitions 
come from the same area of mathematical knowledge and the definitions 
from different notations do not intersect heavily. 

Additionally, we can introduce a document-centric view on the mathematical 
namespaces: suppose we have a collection of documents of $n$ documents 
$\mathcal D = \{ d_1, d_2, \ ... \ , d_n \}$ and a set of namespaces 
$\{(n_1, \mathcal N_1), (n_2, \mathcal N_2), \ ... \ ,$ $(n_K, \mathcal N_K) \}$. 
A document $d_j$ can use a namespace $(n_k, \mathcal N_k)$ by \emph{importing} 
identifiers from it. To import an identifier, the document uses an import statement 
where the identifier $i$ is referred by its fully qualified name
defined by this namespace. 

\textbf{TODO}: Continue, re-introduce low coupling and high cohesion in terms of 
document collection. 


However, in real-life scientific documents there are no import statements in the document
preamble, and therefore ...

The goal is to automatically discover the set of mathematical namespaces 
given a collection of documents. 

Manual labeling is time consuming 

Want: approximation via ML algorithms

To do that need to be able to extract definition from text

% How to find a namespace? Can be constructed manually using existent category information
%(refer to that list of categories of scientific articles)

% But it's very time consuming. Our approach: use ML techniques to automatically discover
% the namespaces from corpus with mathematical formulas.

% To use it, we first need to map identifiers to their definitions, and this can be done by
% extracting the definitions from the text that surrounds the formula. We explore these methods
% in section \ref{section:definitionextraction}.



\subsection{Outcomes}

% maybe there should be a better name for the section?

\textbf{TODO:} taken form the proposal.
The main idea here to describe what can happen if we solve the problem of 
namespace discovery in notation.

\ \\

Once such namespaces are found, they can give good categorization of scientific documents based on formulae and notation used in them.

We believe that this may facilitate better user experience: for instance, it will allow users to navigate easily between documents of the same category and see in which other documents a particular identifier is used, how it is used, how it is derived, etc. Additionally, it may give a way to avoid ambiguity. If we follow the XML approach \cite{xmlnamespaces} and prepend namespace to the identifier, e.g. ``physics.$E$'', then it will give additional context and make it clear that ``physics.$E$'' means ``energy" rather than ``expected value".

We also expect that using namespaces is beneficial for relating identifiers to definitions. Thus, as an application of namespaces, we would like to be able to use them for better definition extraction. It may help to overcome some of the current problems in this area, for example, the problem of \emph{dangling identifiers} \cite{pagael2014mlp} - identifiers that are used in formulae but never defined in the document. Such identifiers may be defined in other documents that share the same namespace, and thus we can take the definition from the namespace and assign it to the dangling identifier.


\subsection{Thesis Outline}


This work is organized as follows: 
In chapter~\ref{sec:definitionextraction-top} we discuss how extract
definitions for identifiers in texts with mathematical formulae;
in chapter~\ref{sec:namespaces-top} the approaces to namespace
extraction and we argue why the cluster analysis can be used for that;
in chapter~\ref{sec:doc-clustering} we review cluster analysis methods
and in chapter~\ref{sec:latent-semantics} we discuss how to extract
latent information from data using different matrix factorization
techniques. Finally, we describe how the techniques are implemented
(chapter~\ref{sec:implementation}) and evaluated (chapter~\ref{sec:evaluation}).
