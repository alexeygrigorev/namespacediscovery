\section{Introduction}

In computer science, a \emph{namespace} refers to a collection of terms
that are grouped because they share functionality or purpose,
typically for providing modularity and resolving name conflicts \cite{duval2002metadata}.
For example, XML uses namespaces to prefix element names to ensure uniqueness and remove ambiguity between them \cite{xmlnamespaces}, and the Java programming language uses packages to organize identifiers into namespaces for modularity \cite{gosling2014java}.

In this thesis we extend the notion of namespaces to mathematical formulae. 
In mathematics, there exists a special system of choosing identifers, and it is called 
\emph{mathematical notation} \cite{wikinotation}. Because of the notation, 
when people write ``$E=mc^2$'', the meaning of this expression is recognized among scientists. 
However, the same identifier may be used in different areas, but denote 
different things: For example, ``$E$\,'' may refer to ``energy'', ``expected value'' or 
``elimination matrix'', depending on the domain of the article.
We can compare this problem with the problem of name collision in computer science 
and introduce namespaces of identifiers in mathematical notation to overcome it. 

In this work we aim to discover namespaces of identifiers in mathematical notation. 
However, the notation only exists in the documents where it is used, and it does 
not exist in isolation. 
It means that the identifer namespaces should be discovered from the documents 
with mathematical formulae. 
Therefore, the goal of this work is to \textbf{automatically discover a set of identifier
namespaces given a collection of documents}.

\textbf{TODO: Should I describe here that we want to use the document clustering
techniques? or it goes to the chap3?}

We expect the namespaces to be meaningful, in the sense that they can be related to real-world areas of knowledge, such as physics, linear algebra or statistics.

Once such namespaces are found, they can give good categorization of scientific 
documents based on formulas and notation used in them. We believe that this may 
facilitate better user experience: when learning a new area it will help the users 
familiarize with the notation faster.
Additionally, it may also help to locate the usages of a particular identifier and 
refer to other documents where the identifier is used. 

Namespaces also give a way to avoid ambiguity. If we refer to an identifier from a 
particular namespace, then it is clear what the semantic meaning of this 
identifier. For example, if we say that ``$E$\,'' belongs to a namespaces 
about physics, it gives additional context and makes it clear that ``$E$\,''
means ``energy'' rather than ``expected value''.

Finally, using namespaces is beneficial for relating identifiers to 
definitions. Thus, as an application of namespaces, we can use them for better 
definition extraction. It will help to overcome some of the current problems in 
this area, for example, the problem of dangling identifiers~-- identifiers that are 
used in  formulas but never defined in the document \cite{pagael2014mlp}. 
Such identifiers may be defined in other documents that share the same namespace, 
and thus we can take the definition from the namespace and assign it to the dangling identifier.
