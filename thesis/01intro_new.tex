\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Namespaces}

Problem statement

CS: problem of name collisions

Namespaces: to solve the problem and encapsulate items

example: OS, folders to group related files

XML, Programming languages, java: packages are namespaces. 

\ \\

Here: extend this to mathematical formulas



Usage: gives a way to distinguish between physics.$E$ and statistics.$E$.



\section{Document clustering}



So the algorithm:

\begin{itemize}
  \item  find clusters
  \item evaluate purity of each cluster (keeping these clusters big enough to form a meaningful namespace)
  \item keep only pure ones
  \item postprocess pure cluster to form namespaces from them (maybe even hierarchically)
\end{itemize}




Clustering algorithms used: DBScan, Shared Nearest Neighborhood Clustering (SNN Clustering), K-means, Mini-Batch K-means, Bisecting K-means, Latent Semantic Analysis + K-Means
Also SNN on LSA with cosine.

Similarity/distance measures: jaccard, cosine, euclidean
