describe the approach to solve the problem

VSM also extend it to identifiers and discuss how definitions can
be incorporated in this space.


\subsection{Identifier Vector Space Model}

The Vector Space Model can be adjusted to represent documents by identifers
they contain instead of words. To do that we replace the vocabulary $\mathcal V$
with  a set of identifiers $\mathcal I = \{ i_1, i_2, \ ... \ , i_m \}$,
but documents are still represented as $m$-vectors $\mathbf d_j = (w_1, w_2, \ ... \ , w_m)$,
where $w_k$ is a weight of identifier $i_k$ in the document $\mathbf d_j$.
Likewise, we can define an identifier-document matrix $D$ as a matrix where
columns are document vectors and rows are indexed by the identifiers.

Identifiers, as terms, suffer from the problems of synonymy and polysemy,
and we solve this problem by extracting definitions for all the identifiers.
There are several ways of incorporating the extracted definitions into the
model:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item do not include definition information at all, use only identifiers;
  \item use ``weak'' identifier-definition association: include identifiers and
        definitions as separate dimensions;
  \item use ``strong'' association: append definition to identifier.
\end{itemize}

To illustrate how it is done, consider three relations ($E$, ``energy''),
($m$, ``mass'') and ($c$, ``speed of light''), and three documents
$d_1 = \{E, m, c\}, d_2 = \{ m, c\}, d_3 = \{ E \}$. Then

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item no definitions: dimensions are ($E$, $m$, $c$) and the identifier-document matrix is
  $$D = \left[
    \begin{array}{c|ccc}
       & d_1 & d_2 & d_3 \\
      \hline
      E & 1 & 0 & 1  \\
      m & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
      c & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    \end{array}
  \right];$$
  \item ``weak'' association: dimensions are ($E$, $m$, $c$, energy, mass,
  speed of light), and the matrix is $$D = \left[
    \begin{array}{r|ccc}
       & d_1 & d_2 & d_3 \\
      \hline
      E                     & 1 & 0 & 1  \\
      m                     & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
      c                     & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
      \text{energy}         & 1 & 0 & 1  \\
      \text{mass}           & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
      \text{speed of light} & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    \end{array}
  \right];$$
  \item ``strong'' association: dimensions are ($E$\_energy, $m$\_mass, $c$\_speed of light), and the matrix is $$D = \left[
    \begin{array}{r|ccc}
       & d_1 & d_2 & d_3 \\
      \hline
      E\text{\_energy} & 1 & 0 & 1  \\
      m\text{\_mass} & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
      c\text{\_speed of light} & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    \end{array}
  \right].$$
\end{itemize}
