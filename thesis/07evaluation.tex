\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

In section \ref{sec:param-tuning} we describe how we select
the best clustering algorithm.



\subsection{Result analysis}

Hierarcical methods are too slow, and SLINK is not good.
Bisecting $K$-Means is good for explaining steps but not very practical

MiniBatch K means is preferred to usual KMeans:
fast but same results

NMF takes a lot of time to decompose a matrix with large
$k$

 $k=100$ 30 min, but with results inferior to SVD
 $k=250$ 2 hours, with results comparable to SVD

The complexity of NMF is $O(kn)$


The best definition embedding technique is soft association
The best clsutering algorithm is $K$-Means with $K=10000$
on the semantic space produced by rank-reduced SVD with $k = 200$
