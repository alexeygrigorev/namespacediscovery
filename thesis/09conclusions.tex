\section{Conclusions}


\subsection{Future Work}


While I was reading, it occurred to me that one document may have several namespaces, but I'm not yet sure how to model it. Maybe by taking a small context around each formula and treating it as a small document? Or I should hold this thought and wait till we maybe obtain some results from other simpler methods?



Use semi-supervised techniques for evaluation



Pages that describe certain namespaces may be quite interconnected.
There are link-based clustering methods e.g. Botafogo and Schneiderman 1991

Can extract wiki graph and use this for clustering .
There are hybrid approaches that use both usual textual representation  + links
\cite{oikonomakou2005review}


It can be interesting to apply these tecnhiques to a larger dataset, for example, arXiv.
